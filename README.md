# IoT-Based-Smart-Plug-with-Dual-Control-Manual-and-Remote
This project introduces an IoT-enabled smart plug that allows users to control electrical appliances through both manual switches and a smartphone app (Blynk). The system utilizes an ESP8266 microcontroller, a relay module, and a voltage sensor to provide real-time monitoring and seamless synchronization between manual and remote controls.
