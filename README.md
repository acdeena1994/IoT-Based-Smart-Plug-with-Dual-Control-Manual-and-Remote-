# IoT-Based-Smart-Plug-with-Dual-Control-Manual-and-Remote
This project introduces an IoT-enabled smart plug that allows users to control electrical appliances through both manual switches and a smartphone app (Blynk). The system utilizes an ESP8266 microcontroller, a relay module, and a voltage sensor to provide real-time monitoring and seamless synchronization between manual and remote controls.


## ðŸš€ Features & Advantages
âœ” **Dual Control** â€“ Manual (Two-Way Switch) & IoT (Blynk App).
âœ” **Real-Time Monitoring** â€“ View power usage and appliance status on **Blynk Dashboard**.
âœ” **Seamless Synchronization** â€“ Whether controlled manually or via IoT, the system stays updated.
âœ” **Remote Access** â€“ Turn appliances ON/OFF from anywhere via **Blynk Cloud**.
